# HyperbolicTriangle
Produces nxn faithful, irreducible representations (matrices) for hyperbolic triangle groups T(p,q,r) = &lt;a,b,c|a^p = b^q = c^r = abc = 1> in PSL(n,R) by composing the holonomy representation T(p,q,r) -> PSL(2,R) with the unique irreducible representation PSL(2,R) -> PSL(n,R).
